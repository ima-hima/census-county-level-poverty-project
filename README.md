# County-level poverty data
#### Analyze census data income by county and state

1. Determine the top ten zipcodes most afflicted by poverty by grouping them by rate (expressed as a %) below poverty level.

    1. As an example, one dataset should be the top ten most impoverished zip codes in the United States based on the total percentage impacted. This might mean that low-income and low-population cities show up first, or that low-income high-population urban clusters show up—that is up to you to determine and prove your logic.

    1. Classify the poverty percentages into discrete buckets (e.g. 20–40% below poverty level, 40–60% below poverty level, etc.) and provide some analysis on the distribution of zipcodes in each bucket.

    1. Conduct a more detailed geographic analysis—determine which states have the highest proportions of impoverished zipcodes.

1. Create several tables in PostgreSQL to store this information in a simple and relational manner.

1. Conduct the analyses either directly in Python (and load the results to PostgreSQL), or load the raw data into PostgreSQL and write queries to analyze the data—determine and justfy the better choice.
